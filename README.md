> Help me increase signal strength on this repo - give it a  ⭐

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense, even when you're working on a shoestring, to keep these projects online and freely available.

If you'd like more info about how you can help out, head to [my sponsor's page][sponsors].
